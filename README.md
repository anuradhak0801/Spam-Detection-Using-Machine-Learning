## ðŸ“§ Spam-Ham Message Classification using Machine Learning

Unwanted and unsolicited messagesâ€”commonly known as **spam**â€”are a growing problem across email, SMS, and messaging platforms. They not only clutter inboxes but can also pose serious security threats like phishing or scams. Accurate spam detection is essential to ensure a safe and seamless user experience.

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** that can classify messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam) based on their content. The model uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction and a **Logistic Regression** classifier, enhanced with techniques like **SMOTE** for class balance and **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

This falls under the domains of **Cybersecurity**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **AI-Powered Communication Tools**, benefiting **Email Service Providers**, **Messaging Platforms**, **Telecom Operators**, **Spam Detection APIs**, and **User Security Applications**.
